Welcome to the new website for Leopard Robotics, the Lake Middle School
collection of FIRST&reg; Tech Challenge Teams! This site will continue to evolve
as we continue to organize and plan for the upcoming 2017-2018 season!
Currently, there are over 60 students interested in participating, and almost 20
volunteer, parent mentors!

Today marks the end of the first meeting of mentors, and it was very successful,
indeed. We have enough volunteer support to form at least five initial teams,
and so now begins plans for how to bring those teams together, and how to fund
the initial investment for those teams.

If you're interested in becoming involved, please visit the About link above.
